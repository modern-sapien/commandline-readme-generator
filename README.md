## Description
This project answers the age old question of, how much more efficient can I be with my time? A command line README generator, saves a developer countless minutes agonizing over remembering what goes where & why by using a series of prompts to move through the arduous task of generating a README. This readme generator was developed using NPM init, NPM install, & an effective use of backticks.
